/******************************************************************************
 * This example shows how to use the ShiftPWM library to PWM many outputs.
 * All shift registers are chained, so they can be driven with 3 pins from the arduino.
 * A timer interrupt updates all PWM outputs according to their duty cycle setting.
 * The outputs can be inverted by making ShiftPWM_invertOutputs true.
 *
 * How the library works:
 * The ShiftPWM class keeps a setting for the duty cycle for each output pin, which
 * can be set using the provided functions. It also keeps a counter which it compares
 * to these duty cycles. This timer continuously runs from 0 to the maximum duty cycle.
 *
 * A timer interrupt is configured by ShiftPWM.Start(pwmFrequency,maxBrightness).
 * The interrupt frequency is set to pwmFrequency * (maxBrightness+1).
 * Each interrupt all duty cycles are compared to the counter and the corresponding pin
 * is written 1 or 0 based on the result. Then the counter is increased by one.
 *
 * The duration of the interrupt depends on the number of shift registers (N).
 * T = 112 + 43*N
 *
 * The load of the interrupt function on your program can be calculated:
 * L = Interrupt frequency * interrupt duration / clock frequency
 * L = F*(Bmax+1)*(112+43*N)/F_CPU
 * Quick reference for load:
 * 3 registers  255 maxBrightness 75Hz  load = 0.29
 * 6 registers  255 maxBrightness 75Hz  load = 0.45
 * 24 registers 100 maxBrightness 75Hz  load = 0.54
 * 48 registers  64 maxBrightness 75Hz  load = 0.66
 * 96 registers  32 maxBrightness 75Hz  load = 0.66
 *
 * A higher interrupt load will mean less computional power for your main program,
 * so try to keep it as low as possible and at least below 0.9.
 *
 * The following functions are used:
 *
 * ShiftPWM.Start(int ledFrequency, int max_Brightness)		Enable ShiftPWM with desired frequency and brightness levels
 * ShiftPWM.SetAmountOfRegisters(int newAmount)			Set or change the amount of output registers. Can be changed at runtime.
 * ShiftPWM.PrintInterruptLoad()				Print information on timer usage, frequencies and interrupt load
 * ShiftPWM.OneByOneSlow()  				        Fade in and fade out all outputs slowly
 * ShiftPWM.OneByOneFast()					Fade in and fade out all outputs fast
 * ShiftPWM.SetOne(int pin, unsigned char value)		Set the duty cycle of one output
 * ShiftPWM.SetAll(unsigned char value)				Set all outputs to the same duty cycle
 *
 * ShiftPWM.SetGroupOf2(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1);
 * ShiftPWM.SetGroupOf3(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2);
 * ShiftPWM.SetGroupOf4(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2, unsigned char v3);
 * ShiftPWM.SetGroupOf5(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2, unsigned char v3, unsigned char v4);
 * 		--> Set a group of outputs to the given values. SetGroupOf3 is useful for RGB LED's. Each LED will be a group.
 *
 * Debug information for wrong input to functions is also send to the serial port,
 * so check the serial port when you run into problems.
